The session was well recieved!  

Feedback:  
* more visualizations in the regression notebook (for optimization/minimization and gradient descent). Would be great to have animations of a line being fit.  
* deeper explanation of linear regression since other methods use the same steps
* keep notebook approach, very pleasing
* Add more youtube videos inline and play them to break up the session
* Confirm Windows 10 installation details or set up servers in the cloud for attendees to access.
